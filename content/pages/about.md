About the Journal
-----------------
*Physiome* papers describe the details of mathematical models and computational simulations associated with a ‘primary’ experimental/modelling paper that has been published (or accepted for publication) in a peer-reviewed physiology, bioengineering or biophysics journal. Submissions to *Physiome* are evaluated to determine their **reproducibility**, **reusability**, and **discoverability**. At a minimum, accepted submissions are guaranteed to be in an executable state that reproduces the modelling predictions in the primary paper, and are archived for permanent access by the community. *Physiome* will also publish papers based on older primary modelling papers where there is substantial value to the physiological modelling community in making a reusable, reproducible, and discoverable version of the model available. *Physiome* papers are citable with a DOI and published as open access with a author processing charge of US$300.

The purpose of *Physiome* is to encourage the reproducibility and reuse of models by providing citation credit for papers that describe and document curated and annotated models. The journal will assist authors in making suitable submissions available in the *Physiome* encoding standards ([CellML](https://www.cellml.org/), [FieldML](http://www.fieldml.org/), [SBML](http://sbml.org/), [NeuroML](https://www.neuroml.org/) for encoding the model; [SED-ML](http://sed-ml.org/) for encoding the simulation procols, parameters and outputs).

Note that a submission (***Original*** or ***Retrospective***) will only be accepted for *Physiome* if the primary paper that describes the experiments, data and model(s) has been accepted by a recognised peer-reviewed journal (referred to here as the ‘primary journal’). The exception to this will be submitted and solicited ***Reviews***, that document a range of published models in a given area, and submitted ***Letters***, that provide new insights on published models (see more details under 'Instructions to Authors'). For some primary journals the submission of the companion modelling paper to *Physiome* may proceed in parallel so that the curated, annotated and documented model is available at the time of publication of the primary paper. Authors are therefore encouraged to prepare their *Physiome* submission(s) in parallel to the primary paper. Submissions will not be curated and evaluated until the primary paper is accepted, but authors will be able to access and share their submission via the *[Physiome Model Repository](https://models.physiomeproject.org)*, or other suitable repository.

*Physiome* articles will be available on the *Physiome* [portal on Figshare](https://physiome.figshare.com), where the *Physiome* paper and the collection of models and data are available and citable. When appropriate, “live” models and simulation descriptions will also be available in the *[Physiome Model Repository](https://models.physiomeproject.org)* and the journal website. Wherever possible, models encoded in the standard formats are available to run from directly from this website.
